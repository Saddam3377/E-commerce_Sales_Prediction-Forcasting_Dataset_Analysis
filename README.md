# E-commerce_Sales_Prediction-Forcasting_Dataset_Analysis_PowerBI
The objective of this project is to analyze historical e-commerce sales data and create interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI to uncover insights, identify trends, and forecast future sales performance. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for marketing, inventory, and operations teams.

**Dataset Overview:**

The dataset used includes key attributes such as:

Order Date, Ship Date

Product Category & Sub-category

**Key Steps & Methodology:**

*Data Import & Transformation (Power Query)*

Cleaned and pre-processed raw data using Power Query Editor.

Handled null values, data type conversions, and created date hierarchies.

Split columns (e.g., year/month from Order Date) for time-based analysis.

*Data Modeling*

Created relationships between dimension and fact tables (e.g., Date, Product, Customer).

Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculated columns and measures:

Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Discount, YoY Growth %, etc.
